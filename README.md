## Introduction

The AI-Driven Customer Support project is designed to leverage AI agents for streamlining and automating customer support processes. For demonstration purposes, this tool utilizes support articles from the Coursera platform. It processes incoming email queries from customers and generates responses based on the available support articles.

This implementation serves as a demonstration of the tool's capabilities. However, it can be further integrated with any company's internal data systems, especially those that include historical responses from human agents.

The tool can be easily integrated into existing systems to automatically trigger responses upon receiving an email. For more practical applications, fine-tuning the language model with a company’s own customer service data would enhance its effectiveness and relevance.


## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understand and generate human-like text responses.
- **Chatbot Integration:** Can be seamlessly integrate with chat platforms.
- **Knowledge Base Integration:** Access and retrieve information from knowledge bases for quick resolutions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

#### 1. Data Collection

Data is collected from [Coursera's Learner Help Center](https://www.coursera.support/s/learner-help-center?language=en_US) using web scraping techniques. The `web_scrape.ipynb` notebook scrapes a set of support articles that address frequently asked questions. The collected links are stored in the `support_links.txt` file for reference.

#### 2. Response Generation Using AI Agents

The AI-driven customer support system consists of two key agents:
- **Customer Support Agent:** Handles incoming email queries and generates responses based on available support articles.
- **Support Quality Assurance Agent:** Reviews the generated responses to ensure they meet quality standards.

The backend utilizes Llama-3 via Ollama for various language operations. Upon receiving an email data, the system matches the subject line with available support articles in the database. The top 3 matching articles' URLs are sent to the AI agents for reference, as managed by the `get_links.py` file. The response generation process is handled by the `ai_agent.py` file.

#### 3. Email/Chatbot Integration

Future integration will involve connecting the system with email services (e.g., Google Auth for Gmail or other email APIs) to monitor incoming emails and automatically reply based on the responses generated by the AI agents.
